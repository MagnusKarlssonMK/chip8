My attempt at making a CHIP8 emulator in Rust.

Following the guide at https://tobiasvl.github.io/blog/write-a-chip-8-emulator/

Currently only supports simple CHIP-8. I might return to add support for SUPER-CHIP in the future.

OP code quirks and some other settings can be changed in [options](options.toml).
